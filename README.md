# Kognys: Decentralized Research Framework

Kognys is a decentralized research framework powered by autonomous agents and verifiable memory. Built on the BNB Chain, it enables collaborative knowledge creation across any research domain. By combining a "Chain-of-Debate" reasoning process with persistent, decentralized memory provided by Unibase, Kognys offers a powerful infrastructure for generating and verifying structured knowledge at scale.

This project is a submission for the BNB AI Hackathon (Unibase Track).

## Core Features

- **Autonomous Research Agents**: A multi-agent system built with LangGraph that collaborates to research topics, synthesize information, and refine answers.
- **Chain-of-Debate Reasoning**: Specialized agents (Synthesizer, Challenger, Checklist, Reviser) debate and critique findings to improve accuracy and depth, inspired by Microsoftâ€™s MAI-DxO system.
- **Decentralized Memory**: Integrated with Unibase, Kognys agents can register on-chain identities and store their findings on a decentralized data availability (DA) layer, creating a permanent, verifiable knowledge base.
- **Multi-Source Retrieval**: The `RetrieverAgent` gathers information from multiple academic sources simultaneously, including OpenAlex, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar.
- **REST API**: A FastAPI server provides endpoints to run the research agent and retrieve its findings.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ and `pip`
- A `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
  MEMBASE_ID="kognys-agent-001"
  MEMBASE_ACCOUNT="<YOUR_BNB_TESTNET_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>"
  DA_SERVICE_URL="[https://kognys-da-production.up.railway.app](https://kognys-da-production.up.railway.app)"
  ```

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd kognys-agents-python
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the API Server Locally

To start the FastAPI server for development and testing:

```bash
python -m uvicorn api_main:app --reload
```

The API server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## ðŸ“– API Documentation

The Kognys API provides a simple interface to interact with the research agent.

Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (for local) or your public Railway URL.

1. **Health Check**

Checks if the API server is running.

- Endpoint: `GET /`
- Method: `GET`
- Response (200 OK):

  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "message": "Kognys Research Agent API is running."
  }
  ```

  - Example:

  ```bash
  curl [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
  ```

2. **Run Research Agent**

Triggers the Kognys agent to perform research on a given topic. The agent will run its full "Chain-of-Debate" process and store the final answer on the Unibase DA layer.

- Endpoint: `POST /papers`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:

  ```json
  {
    "message": "The research question to investigate.",
    "user_id": "A unique identifier for the user or session."
  }
  ```

- Success Response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "paper_id": "The unique ID for this research run.",
  "paper_content": "The final, formatted research paper generated by the agent."
}
```

- Example:

```bash
curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers](http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers) \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "message": "What are the ethical implications of large language models?",
  "user_id": "frontend-user-12345"
}'
```

3. **Get Research Paper**

Downloads a previously generated paper from the Unibase DA storage layer.

- Endpoint: `GET /papers/{paper_id}`
- Method: `GET`
- Path Parameter:

  ```
  paper_id (string, required): The unique ID of the paper to retrieve. This ID is generated by the Unibase DA service when the paper is first created.
  ```

- Success Response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "paper_id": "The ID of the retrieved paper.",
  "paper_content": "The content of the research paper.",
  "user_id": "The user ID associated with the paper (if available)."
}
```

Example:

```bash
curl [http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/3d162a71-222e-5ef9-8fdd-781a7590dc6d](http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/3d162a71-222e-5ef9-8fdd-781a7590dc6d)
```
